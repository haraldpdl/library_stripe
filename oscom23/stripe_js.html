<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Securely Stored Payment Cards (Tokens)</h3>

<p>Stored tokens allows customers to securely save their card payment information during their purchase and to reference the stored card in their next purchase without having to re-type their card information again. The card payment information is securely stored at Stripe's servers and is referenced with a unique token code.</p>

<h4 class="notoc">Requirements</h4>

<p>Stored tokens requires the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stripe Cards Management Page content module; it is important to enable the Stripe Cards Management Page content module to allow customers to manage their stored cards in their account area. The content module can be found on the Administration Tool -> Modules -> Content -> Install Module page.</li>
  <li>Content Modules; as Stripe Cards Management Page is a content module, it requires the Content Modules implementation introduced in osCommerce Online Merchant v2.3.4. Please refer to its <a href="{link}Online|Library|en&oscom_2_3&release_notes&v2_3_4{link}">release notes</a> to add the implementation into your existing store.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SSL Certificate Verified Transactions</h3>

<p>All secured API transaction calls sent to Stripe are performed by verifying Stripe's SSL certificates to guarantee the identity of Stripe. This is performed by using the following public keys in order if they are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ext/modules/payment/stripe/stripe.com.crt</li>
  <li>includes/cacert.pem (public key bundle)</li>
  <li>the web server configured public key bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>A test connection link is available on the payment module configuration page which can be used to test if API transaction calls to Stripe can be verified from your web server. If the test connection fails, please contact your hosting provider as they may need to update your web server configuration. The SSL certificate verification can also be disabled on the payment module configuration page however it is highly discouraged to disable.</p>

<div class="alert">Some web hosting providers require a curl proxy to be used which can be configured on the payment module configuration page.</div>

<h2>Manual Installation (as an Add-On)</h2>

<p>After extracting the Add-On package, copy the files located in the <em>catalog</em> directory to your osCommerce installation directory on the server. The files must be copied in the correct directory structure as extracted from the Add-On package.</p>

<p>The file listing is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>includes/languages/english/modules/payment/stripe.php</li>
  <li>includes/modules/payment/stripe.php</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard language definitions in English are provided in the Add-On package. For additional languages, copy the English language definition file to the appropriate language directory and open the file with a text editor to edit the language definitions. The location of the language definition file must be in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>includes/languages/<em>LANGUAGE</em>/modules/payment/stripe.php</li>
</ul>

<p>When the files have been copied to their appropriate locations, the payment module will be available on the Administration Tool -> Modules -> Payment -> Install Module page where it can be installed, or on the Administration Tool -> Modules -> Payment page if the module was already previously installed.</p>

<p>If the module was already previously installed, it is important to visit the module configuration page to make sure new parameters are automatically installed in the database.</p>
